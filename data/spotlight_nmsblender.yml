content: |
  Created in 2019, the <i>No Man's Sky Base Building Blender Addon</i> is a add-on extension for Blender 3.0+, introducing a way to create and edit No Man's Sky bases within the 3D application. It allowed players to push their creativity to the limits and is still being used by a community of base builders today.
