  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
  Tales from the Dancing Moon is a life-sim RPG set in a parallel universe inspired by UK culture and fantasy novels. After the events of a shadow-beast invasion on a seaside town, complete villager quests and collect hidden diaries to understand your role in this mysterious character-driven story.
  </p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
  The idea of Tales from The Dancing Moon formed back in 2012 after I left University and has been in my head ever since. It’s story is inspired by “portal-story” adventures, such as Narnia or Alice in Wonderland.
  </p>
  <p>
  The details of the story evolved over the course of many years as I worked my day job as a Technical Artist for film visual effects. When the pandemic hit in early 2020 and the UK went into lockdown, I used my time to learn Unreal Engine – which kickstarted my interest in game development.
  </p>
  <p>
  A year and a half into the pandemic (October 2021) I released the demo on Steam, and reached the front page of Reddit with some of my postings. This encouraged me to continue developing and work towards a full version of the game.
  </p>
  <p>
  The plan is to enter Early Access in 2023 – in which the quests for the main story (that has been swimming around in my head all of this time) will finally be playable.
