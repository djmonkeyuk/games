Please view the [Importing from NMS](/no-mans-sky-base-builder-blender/guides/importing-from-nms/) guide if you haven't already. You will need to be familiar with Save Editing and your base data location before proceeding.

When you are happy with the modifications you've made to your base using Blender, we can export this back into the game.

This basically is the reverse of the [Importing from NMS](/no-mans-sky-base-builder-blender/guides/importing-from-nms/) process.

When you're ready, navigate to the File options within the Blender side bar for the add-on and select `Export NMS`

This will directly place the contents of the Blender scene into your clipboard.

You now need to Paste this text back into the same location you previously copied this base from. 

After you've successfully pasted your new data into your save file, close the JSON editor and make sure you save the data applied to your save file (you may be prompted to save in your chosen Save Editor tool). 

You can now load up No Man's Sky see your changes in-game!
