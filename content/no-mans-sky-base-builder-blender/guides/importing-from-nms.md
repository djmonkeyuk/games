Once you've correctly identified your base using any of these tools. You need to select the entire chunk of text that is displayed for that base. You can do this by using the Ctrl+A system hotkey.

Copy this text into your clipboard (Ctrl+C).

Now it's time to bring it into Blender. In the side bar for the add-on - select "Import NMS". This will directly load in the base from your clipboard into the Blender scene.

That's it! Your base or corvette should now display in Blender.

To make edits and bring this back into the game - check out the [Exporting to NMS](/no-mans-sky-base-builder-blender/guides/exporting-to-nms/) page for more details.
