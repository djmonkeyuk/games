Please view the [Importing from NMS](/no-mans-sky-base-builder-app/guides/importing-from-nms/) guide if you haven't already. You will need to be familiar with Save Editing and your base data location before proceeding.

When you are happy with the modifications you've made to your base using the app, we can export this back into the game.

This basically is the reverse of the [Importing from NMS](/no-mans-sky-base-builder-app/guides/importing-from-nms/) process.

When you're ready, navigate to the File menu at the top left and select "Export to NMS..."

You will be presented with a new set of data that your base represents.

You now need to Copy and Paste this text back into the same location you previously copied this base from. There is a button at the top for your convenience to copy all the text to your clipboard. Alternatively you can use the system hotkeys to Select all and Copy (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

After you've successfully pasted your new data into your save file, close the JSON editor and make sure you save the data applied to your save file (you may be prompted to save in your chosen Save Editor tool). 

You can now load up No Man's Sky see your changes in-game!
