## 👋 Introduction

Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of building bases and corvettes in No Man's Sky using a dedicated Base Building application!

This app is designed to be an entry level tool built entirely with No Man's Sky in mind. It's focus on NMS means the learning curve is relatively shallow and has simple 3D tools that allow you to create and edit your bases with more precision and intuitive control.

**<< Please use the buttons on the left to navigate the help guide.**

In the mean time - thank you so much for downloading the app, I hope you enjoy it!

## 🎮 Play my Indie Game!

If you have enjoyed using my tools, consider playing my very own indie game! It is the best way you can support me!

After the events of a shadow-beast invasion on a seaside town, complete villager quests and collect hidden diaries to understand your role in this mysterious character-driven story.*

There is a FREE demo. You would help me a lot by either Wishlisting it, trying it out, or even sharing it with your friends!
