***Note***: Tales from The Dancing Moon is a game with an emphasis on quests and figuring things out for yourself.

That being said, I appreciate the fact that some players need a little nudge in the right direction. If you need help it may be better to ask for hints on the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/kpGVRKPn5W)** or forums before consulting the guides below.

The guides below focus on gameplay actions rather than story, to keep them as story spoiler-free as possible.

## Welcome

***Tales from The Dancing Moon*** is a life-sim RPG set in a parallel universe inspired by UK culture and fantasy novels. After the events of a shadow-beast invasion on a seaside town, complete villager quests and collect hidden diaries to understand your role in this mysterious character-driven story. It is developed by DjMonkey and was released on June 19, 2025. A free demo is also available which contains the full first Act of the game.

The player begins by waking up on ‘*Worms Tail Island*’. They have no memory of how they got there, but Fergus (a local innkeeper) takes them in, letting them stay at his establishment called ***The Dancing Moon*** in the village of ***Illisor***.

The main quest is split into 3 acts and has the player seeking a group of teenagers who went missing before your arrival. The player can complete various side-quests offered by villagers until the player can figure out what needs to be done in order to progress onto the next act of the main quest. During play the player will encounter gameplay such as crafting, farming, fishing, photography, cooking, combat, and tea-brewing.
