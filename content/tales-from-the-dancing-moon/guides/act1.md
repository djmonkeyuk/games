***Note***: Tales from The Dancing Moon is a game with an emphasis on quests and figuring things out for yourself.

That being said, I appreciate the fact that some players need a little nudge in the right direction. If you need help it may be better to ask for hints on the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/kpGVRKPn5W)** or forums before consulting the guides below.

The guides below focus on gameplay actions rather than story, to keep them as story spoiler-free as possible.

## Walkthrough

After waking up on a nearby island, you are taken to ***The Dancing Moon Inn*** where your adventure begins. Itâ€™s a fresh start, with no recollection of your past, so you are tasked with exploring the village and introducing yourself to its various villagers.

Whilst exploring the village and the surrounding areas, you will encounter a main quests - ***A Blocked Cave***. Unblocking the cave and completing this quest is the focus of Act 1.

Going through the tutorial quests and side-quests in act 1 will eventually reveal to you a crafting recipe that can construct 2 types of bomb. A ***Blob-Bomb***, and a ***Shadow-Blaster Bomb***. The ***Blob-Bomb*** on its own is not enough to do environmental damage, so you will need to enhance it by creating the ***Shadow-Blaster Bomb***.

The list below can help you locate resources to craft these particular bombs:
* ***Copper Ingot*** - By mining copper ore from the Dewiland Meadows and crafted using a forge.
* ***Shadow Sludge*** - Looted from defeating Shadow Blobs.
* ***Gun Powder*** - Bought from Val's shop.
* ***Lake Reed*** - Bought from Astryn's Shop
* ***Flint*** - Found on the beaches in the Worm's Tail Region.

Placing a ***Shadow-Blaster Bomb*** near the cave entrance will unblock it and complete the main quest in this act.

If you are playing the demo then this is where the game ends. You will be offered to purchase the full game or return to the demo where you can sandbox or complete any remaining side-quests.

Otherwise - on to the [Act 2 Walkhrough](../act2)!
