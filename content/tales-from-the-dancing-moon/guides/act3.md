***Note***: Tales from The Dancing Moon is a game with an emphasis on quests and figuring things out for yourself.

That being said, I appreciate the fact that some players need a little nudge in the right direction. If you need help it may be better to ask for hints on the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/kpGVRKPn5W)** or forums before consulting the guides below.

The guides below focus on gameplay actions rather than story, to keep them as story spoiler-free as possible.

## Walkthrough 

Act 3 has you exploring new areas of the game, such as the ***Town Hall Dungeon, The Underground Passage***, and the procedural ***Stoknel Swamp*** region.

The main goal in this Act is to steal the necklace that was originally discovered during a side-quest in Act 1 for Oswyn at the museum.

Using the ***Tea of Invisibility*** found in Act 2 may be your first instinct, but there’s something powerful within the necklace that prevents you from doing this if you attempt it.

Instead, as you progress through the Act 3 side quests, you will have access to these various things:
* A dialog option to distract Oswyn.
* A key which opens the door to the Town Hall Dungeons.
* A Tea that enhances the players sprint speed.
* A Tea called “Slick-Skin”, which can be figured out by reading a book in the dungeons. It is based off of the Tea of Invisibility recipe, but swapping 1 ingredient.
* Using Slick-skin tea gives you access to a passage leading from the Town Hall to the Museum.

### Slick-Skin Tea Recipe
* Eel Oil
* Shadow-scented Illisor Tea
* Cactus Flesh (Harvested in the Desert)
* Lily Buds (Bought from Astryn)

### Eel Oil Recipe
*  Eel (fished from the upper region of the Steppes lake)

Using a combination of all the above, you will need to race against the clock to steal back the necklace after distracting Oswyn. You can’t just distract Oswyn and take the necklace, as he will have noticed that you didn’t step outside to follow him. Instead, you will need to head to the plaza and through the hidden passage way and back through to the museum via the other entrance.

This essentially forms a race circuit that spans through the Docks, the Plaza, the Town Hall, the Dungeons, the Hidden Passageway, and finally back to the museum.

If you have trouble with this step, the Tea of Speed which can be harvested from the Swamp region can help you do this before Oswyn returns to his desk. However it is optional and should be doable without it.

Successfully doing the above will allow you to take the necklace back from the museum without Oswyn noticing.

## Final

After finishing Act 3, the only thing left to do is to finish rebuilding the statues in the cave by completing tasks around the village.

You don’t have to 100% everything, but enough to meet a certain threshold.
* James - General completion of side-quests in the journal.
* Roz - Main quest progression (Roz statue should be fully rebuilt by now)
* Desmond - Finding artifacts in the procedural areas.
* Andrew - Finding and reading the diaries.

Upon completing the statues of the teenagers, a structure will appear at the back of the cave.

You will need to have the necklace (key item) and a vial of invisibility tea (in inventory) in order to activate it.

Once activated, you will be sent through to the end-game and finale.

## Post Finale

After the finale sequence there are a few more quest and gameplay options to unlock. Finishing Skye's series of quests will also unlock the repeatable procedural dungeons.

These are the quests which become available after the finale.
* Healing the Lake
* Meal from a Familiar World
* Phone, Keys, ...
* The Endless Dungeons
* The Judgement of Sebastian
