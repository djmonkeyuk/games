***Note***: Tales from The Dancing Moon is a game with an emphasis on quests and figuring things out for yourself.

That being said, I appreciate the fact that some players need a little nudge in the right direction. If you need help it may be better to ask for hints on the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/kpGVRKPn5W)** or forums before consulting the guides below.

The guides below focus on gameplay actions rather than story, to keep them as story spoiler-free as possible.

## Walkthrough

Act 2 has you exploring new areas of the game, such as the ***Mysterious Caves***, the ***Magisters Ruins***, and the procedural ***Noneye Desert*** region.

The first step is to traverse the windy mountain trail. Interacting with the level token will initiate a story scenario. The goal is to visit most of the areas in the scenario cards by using the directional options and take photographs of each one. An alert will appear after you visit each one signalling the quest progression.

If you are struggling to find the photo locations to advance in this part of the quest, you can think of the direction choices like a grid. The photo locations can be found in these, relative to the starting location.

The second step is following instructions from a trail guide written by one of Andrew's Diaries, which can be found behind a rock just at the base of the mountain trail when you've reached this far in the quest.

If you’re having trouble getting past the mountain trail from Andrew’s instructions, the directions are…

***West -> North -> East -> East -> South -> North -> North -> North -> North***

During the next few moments of the story, you will be shown how to brew tea which can give the player various effects. Using the Tea of Sensing in various procedural zones will highlight new tea leaves to experiment with.

In order to complete Act 2, you are tasked with discovering and brewing the ***Tea of Invisibility***.

At this point you can continue to complete side-quests in Act 2. By the end of it, you will find a note by Roz which outlines the various steps to produce the ***Tea of Invisibility***, and you will have advanced enough in the game to be able to brew it. Below are the various ingredients and items you will need...

### Smoked JellySquish Oil Recipe
* JellySquish (fished from the ocean)
* Dry Fiber (Harvested from the Desert)

### Shadow-scented Illisor Tea Recipe
* Illisorian Tea Leaves (Found in the mountain ruins)
* Shadow Sludge (Harvested in the Meadows)
* Shadow Fiber (Harvested in the Desert)

### Invisibility Tea Recipe
* Smoked JellySquish Oil
* Shadow-scented Illisor Tea
* Cactus Flesh (Harvested in the Desert)
* Lily Buds (Bought from Astryn)

After brewing this tea, you will transition into [Act 3](../act3)!
