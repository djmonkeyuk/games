## History
The idea of Tales from The Dancing Moon formed back in 2012 after I left University and has been in my head ever since. It’s story is inspired by “portal-story” adventures, such as Narnia or Alice in Wonderland.

The details of the story evolved over the course of many years as I worked my day job as a Technical Artist for film visual effects. When the pandemic hit in early 2020 and the UK went into lockdown, I used my time to learn Unreal Engine – which kickstarted my interest in game development.

A year and a half into the pandemic (October 2021) I released the demo on Steam, and reached the front page of Reddit with some of my postings. This encouraged me to continue developing and work towards a full version of the game.

The game released into Early Access in 2023, and then later fully released in June 2025.
