## 2. Information We Collect  

We collect only limited information necessary to operate and support the Game.  
The Game does **not** collect personal information such as your real name, email address, or location directly.  

However, some information may be collected through third-party services we use to provide online features or technical support.

### 2.1 Online Features (Achievements and Leaderboards)  

*Tales from The Dancing Moon* includes online features such as achievements and leaderboards.  
These features are provided and managed directly by **Steam** and **Epic Online Services (EOS)**.  

Any information related to your account, achievements, or leaderboard scores is processed under the privacy policies of those platforms:  
- [Steam Privacy Policy](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/)  
- [Epic Games Privacy Policy](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy)  

We do not directly collect or store this information ourselves, though we may view aggregated or anonymized data (for example, general player progress) to help improve the game experience.

### 2.2 Optional Save Files for Debugging  

Occasionally, players may choose to send their game save files to us to help diagnose technical issues or bugs.  
These files may include in-game information such as progress, configuration, or gameplay state.  
We do **not** request or collect personal information through these files.  
Any save files received are used only for debugging purposes and are deleted once the issue has been resolved.
