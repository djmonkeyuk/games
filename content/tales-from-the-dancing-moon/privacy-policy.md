Welcome to *Tales from The Dancing Moon* (‚Äúthe Game‚Äù), developed by **DjMonkey** (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù).  

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you play the Game.

## 2. Information We Collect  

We collect only limited information necessary to support the Game‚Äôs online features (Achievements and Leaderboards) and to provide technical support.  

**Achievements and Leaderboards** are handled directly by **Epic Online Services (EOS)** and **Steam (Valve Corporation)**. These services manage account data, track player progress, and store leaderboard information.  

Through these services, we may **indirectly receive** limited, non-personal information such as:
- **Account identifiers** (e.g., your Epic Games or Steam username or ID).  
- **Gameplay statistics and scores** (such as your progress, achievements, and leaderboard position).  

This information allows us to understand how far players typically progress through the Game and identify areas that may need improvement.  

In addition, some players may **voluntarily send** us:
- **Save files for debugging** ‚Äì These may include in-game data such as progress, settings, or gameplay state. We do not request or collect personal information through these files. They are deleted once the issue is resolved.

We do **not** collect or store personal details such as your real name, email address, or location directly through the Game.

---

## 3. How We Use This Information  

We use the information we access solely for legitimate gameplay and support purposes:
- Displaying achievements and leaderboards (as managed by Epic and Steam).  
- Understanding player progress and gameplay trends.  
- Debugging and resolving technical issues (only when you voluntarily send data).  
- Improving the quality and performance of the Game.  

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data for advertising or marketing purposes.

## 4. Third-Party Services

## 5. Data Storage and Security  

We do **not** store personal data on our own servers.  
All leaderboard, achievement, and account data are securely managed by **Epic Online Services** and **Steam**.  

If you voluntarily send us a save file for debugging, it is stored securely and temporarily. Once the issue has been reviewed or resolved, the file is deleted from our systems.

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect all data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
