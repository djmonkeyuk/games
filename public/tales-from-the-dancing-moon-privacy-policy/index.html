Gameplay statistics and scores (such as your progress, achievements, and leaderboard position). This information allows us to understand how far players typically progress through the Game and identify areas that may need improvement.\nIn addition, some players may voluntarily send us:\nSave files for debugging ‚Äì These may include in-game data such as progress, settings, or gameplay state. We do not request or collect personal information through these files. They are deleted once the issue is resolved.

We do not sell, rent, or share your data for advertising or marketing purposes.\n4. Third-Party Services The Game relies on trusted third-party platforms to manage online functionality and distribution.\nThese services act as independent data controllers for the information they collect directly from you.\nEpic Online Services (EOS) ‚Äì Provides achievements and leaderboards\nhttps://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy\nSteam (Valve Corporation) ‚Äì Provides achievements, leaderboards, and game distribution\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/\nitch.io ‚Äì Provides game distribution\nhttps://itch.io/docs/legal/privacy-policy\nWe do not control how these services collect or process your data.\nWe only access limited, aggregated information from them as part of their platform features.\n5. Data Storage and Security We do not store personal data on our own servers.\nAll leaderboard, achievement, and account data are securely managed by Epic Online Services and Steam.\nIf you voluntarily send us a save file for debugging, it is stored securely and temporarily. Once the issue has been reviewed or resolved, the file is deleted from our systems.\nWe take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect all data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.\n6. Children‚Äôs Privacy The Game is not directed at children under 13 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).\nWe do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received such data, we will delete it promptly.\n7. Your Rights Depending on your region, you may have the right to:\nAccess or request a copy of your data. Request correction or deletion of your data. Object to or restrict data processing. Lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. You can make such requests by contacting: talesfromthedancingmoon@gmail.com\n8. International Data Transfers As a UK-based developer, we process data in accordance with UK and EU data protection laws.\nThird-party services such as Epic and Steam may transfer data outside the UK or EU in accordance with their own legal frameworks and safeguards.\n9.
